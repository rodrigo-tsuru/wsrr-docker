<body>
<p><br>
  An error occurred while starting the launchpad.  This error typically occurs when the launchpad
  is unable to find a supported browser.  Check your product's documentation for a list of supported
  browsers.<br>
  <br>
  NOTE: This file is a place holder for product specific instructions
  about how to recover from this error.<br>
  <br>
  You should describe the location of installation programs on the product CD
  so the user can run them directly without starting launchpad if necessary.<br>
  <br>
  Procedure for correcting the error that is preventing the launchpad from displaying<br>
  ======================================================================<br>
  <br>
  The launchpad supports the following browsers:<br>
  o Mozilla<br>
  o Firefox<br>
  o Internet Explorer (Microsoft Windows platforms only)<br>
  o SeaMonkey<br>
  <br>
  Use the following procedure to attempt to correct the error that is preventing 
  the launchpad from displaying and to try to start the launchpad again:<br>
  <br>
  1. If you do not have the Mozilla Web browser, download and install the Mozilla Web browser from http://www.mozilla.org. <br>
  <br>
  On Linux and UNIX platforms, export the location of the supported browser. For example: <br>
  <br>
  export BROWSER=/usr/bin/mozilla<br>
  <br>  
  2. If the product CD is no longer accessible, insert the CD into a CD drive.  Mount the drive if necessary on Linux and UNIX platforms.<br>
  <br>
  3. Restart the launchpad by issuing the following command: <br>
  <br>
  Linux and UNIX platforms: ./launchpad.sh<br>
  Windows platforms: launchpad.exe<br>
  <br>
